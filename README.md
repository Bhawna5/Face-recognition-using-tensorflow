# Face-recognition-using-tensorflow
This repository contains program for face recognition using transfer learning.
# FaceNet
FaceNet learns a neural network that encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers. By comparing two such vectors, you can then determine if two pictures are of the same person.

# Triplet Loss
Triplet loss function is used which compares three inputs (i.e. Anchor, positive, negative) and tries to bring encoding of two image of same person closer and pulling encoding of different person far away.
